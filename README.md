# PISTE10_Project
This is an integration project where students will use their knowledge in the various fields of telecommunications to achieve a concrete application by collaborating with each other and with the help of a professional team. Our project aims to propose and develop a solution for remote monitoring and control of agricultural infrastructures. The expected benefit is to minimize unnecessary travel farmers and to plan optimized processes for irrigation. This will, on the one hand, make better use of water resources / fertilizer products. It will also allow you to obtain better performance.
